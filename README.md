### Hi there, I'm Steven 👋

<p>I’m a 3 yo fullstack developer (thanks to <a href="https://www.lewagon.com/">Le Wagon Bootcamp</a>) with a strong background in marketing (in love with product and growth 🤓).<br>
Based in Nice, I’m currently enjoying my experience as fullstack web developper and Team Leader! 🤙🏼<br>
In the meantime, I'm working on my own projects to keep learning and discover new things like Machine Learning or Swift language 💪🏼</p>
